          <h3>Why did I receive a judgment?</h3> <p class="jcc-lead">You received a judgment because the court decided against you in a court case. This could have happened in one of a few ways:</p> <h4>By default</h4> <p>Because you didn't respond to the lawsuit.</p> <p>At the beginning of a case, the defendant is supposed to serve you with a few documents including a Summons and Complaint. This means that someone is supposed to hand you or someone in your home or work with a copy of these documents. If they hand it to someone else, a copy is supposed to be mailed to you. This starts your time to respond to the lawsuit. Normally, you have 30 days to respond. If you do not, the other side may request "default" and ask the court to decide the case without you.</p><ul class="jcc-list-group">
            <li>
        <p><strong>I didn't understand I needed to file a response.</strong></p>
        <p>If you act quickly, you may be eligible to "set aside" the default judgment, or you might be able to negotiate a settlement with the debt collector.</p>
      </li>
                <li>
        <p><strong>I didn't know there was a court case.</strong></p>
        <p>Depending on the reasons, you may be eligible to "set aside" the default judgment, or you might be able to negotiate a settlement with the debt collector.</p>
      </li>
            </ul>
<h4>After trial</h4> <p>After each side appears in court to present their case.</p> <h4>After a motion for summary judgment or judgment on the pleadings</h4> <p>After the debt collector files a motion to decide the case without trial.</p>
