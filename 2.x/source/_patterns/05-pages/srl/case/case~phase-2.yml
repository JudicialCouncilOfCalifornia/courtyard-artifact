You need this information to divide your property and debts equally and make decisions about child and spousal support.</p> <h4>You must share financial information by a deadline. </h4><p>The first time you give your spouse this information it’s called preliminary disclosures You must complete preliminary disclosures by a deadline:</p><ul><li>60-days after filing for divorce, if you’re the petitioner </li><li>60-days after you’re served with divorce papers, if you’re the responden</li></ul><p>Sometimes, you also must make a second disclosure, a final disclosure, at the end of your case. This happens if you end up having a trial. If you don’t have a trial, you can waive this final requirement.</p>"
