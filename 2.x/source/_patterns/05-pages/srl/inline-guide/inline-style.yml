  lead: 'When you divorce, the court has to formally approve how you’ll divide your property and debts'
  column_variant: 'has-two-columns-threequarter'
  body: "Part of your divorce involves dividing your property and debts.  Even if you divided everything informally when you separated, the court still needs to make a formal order about these issues. This doesn’t mean you have to go to court. The court could formally approve an agreement you and your spouse write up. If you can't decide, the court can decide for you at a hearing or trial. To tell the court what you want to happen, it helps to know some terms and basic concepts about property law in California. You will see these terms on many of the court forms you’ll need to use."
