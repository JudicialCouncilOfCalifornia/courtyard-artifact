        body: "<p>Once a person is established as the parent of a child, they will have all the rights and responsibilities of a parent:</p> <p>Parents are able to request custody and visitation (parenting time) orders from the court</p> <p>Parents are also responsible for paying child support and will have to pay a portion (usually Â½) of the uninsured health-care costs for the children as well as a portion of child-care costs that result from the custodial parent getting or having a job or going to school.</p> <p>If there is a court order that a person is the parent of a child, that person MUST financially support the child. It is a crime for a legal parent to fail to support his or her child. The parent also has the right to request custody or visitation rights related to the child.</p>"
